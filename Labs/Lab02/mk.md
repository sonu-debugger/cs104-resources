# **HMM POS Tagger and Viterbi Algorithm Explanation**

## **Overview of the Code**
The script is implementing a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagger** using **NLTK** and **scikit-learn**.

### **Key Components and Explanation**

### **1. Importing Required Libraries**
```python
import nltk
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
```
- `nltk`: Used for natural language processing.
- `numpy`: Handles numerical computations.
- `typing`: Provides type hints for better readability.
- `KFold` from `sklearn`: Used for cross-validation.

---

### **2. Downloading and Loading the Brown Corpus**
```python
nltk.download("brown")
nltk.download("universal_tagset")

from nltk.corpus import brown

tagged_sentences = brown.tagged_sents(tagset="universal")
tagged_sentences = list(tagged_sentences)
```
- Downloads the **Brown corpus**, which is a collection of English text with tagged words.
- Uses the **Universal POS Tagset** for tagging.
- Retrieves **tagged sentences**, meaning each word in a sentence is associated with a POS tag.

---

### **3. Defining the HMM POS Tagger Class**
```python
class HMMPOSTagger:
    def __init__(self, tagged_sentences: List[List[Tuple[str, str]]]):
        """ Initialize HMM POS Tagger with BOS and EOS tokens """
        self.BOS_TOKEN = '<BOS>'
        self.EOS_TOKEN = '<EOS>'
```
- Defines a **Hidden Markov Model POS Tagger**.
- Introduces **special tokens** (`<BOS>` for beginning of sentence, `<EOS>` for end of sentence).
  
---

### **4. Extracting Unique Tags and Words**
```python
self.tags = set(tag for sent in tagged_sentences for _, tag in sent)
self.words = set(word.lower() for sent in tagged_sentences for word, _ in sent)
```
- **Extracts unique POS tags** from the dataset.
- **Extracts unique words**, converting them to lowercase for normalization.

---

## **Viterbi Algorithm in the Context of Your Code**
The **Viterbi Algorithm** is a dynamic programming algorithm used to find the most probable sequence of hidden states (POS tags) given an observed sequence (words in a sentence). In the case of your **HMM POS Tagger**, it helps determine the best sequence of POS tags for a given sentence.

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

### **1. Define Probabilities**
- **Transition Probability (A)**: The probability of a tag **T2** occurring after tag **T1**.
  \[
  P(T2 | T1) = \frac{\text{Count(T1 â†’ T2)}}{\text{Count(T1)}}
  \]
  Example: If **"the" (DET)** is often followed by **"dog" (NOUN)**, the probability \( P(NOUN | DET) \) will be high.

- **Emission Probability (B)**: The probability of a word **W** appearing given a tag **T**.
  \[
  P(W | T) = \frac{\text{Count(T â†’ W)}}{\text{Count(T)}}
  \]
  Example: If **"dog"** is frequently labeled as **NOUN**, then \( P(dog | NOUN) \) will be high.

### **2. Initialize Viterbi Table**
The algorithm maintains a **Viterbi table** where:
- Rows = **POS tags** (hidden states)
- Columns = **Words in the sentence** (observed states)
- Each cell stores the **best probability of reaching that word with a given POS tag**.

Example table for the sentence:  
*"The dog runs"*

| Time step | The (DET) | Dog (NOUN) | Runs (VERB) |
|-----------|----------|------------|-------------|
| DET       | **1.0**  | 0          | 0           |
| NOUN      | 0        | **max(DETâ†’NOUN * emission prob.)** | 0 |
| VERB      | 0        | 0          | **max(NOUNâ†’VERB * emission prob.)** |

### **3. Recursion (Dynamic Programming)**
For each word \( W_t \) in the sentence and each tag \( T_j \):

\[
V(t, j) = \max_{i} (V(t-1, i) \times P(T_j | T_i) \times P(W_t | T_j))
\]
Where:
- \( V(t, j) \) is the best probability of reaching word \( W_t \) with tag \( T_j \).
- \( P(T_j | T_i) \) is the transition probability.
- \( P(W_t | T_j) \) is the emission probability.

### **4. Backtracking**
Once the table is filled, we backtrack from the last word to the first to **recover the best sequence of tags**.

---

## **How This Relates to Your Code**
Your **HMMPOSTagger** class is implementing this logic to:
1. **Train on the Brown corpus** to compute transition and emission probabilities.
2. **Use the Viterbi algorithm** to determine the best sequence of POS tags for an input sentence.

---

## **Checking for Viterbi Implementation in the Code**
It looks like your script **does not explicitly define a `viterbi` function**, but since it's an **HMM POS Tagger**, it must still be implementing Viterbi somewhereâ€”perhaps inside another function or class method.

---

## **Next Steps**
Would you like to:
1. **Find where Viterbi is implemented** in your code and explain it?  
2. **Add a Viterbi function** if it's missing, so the tagger can work properly?  

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
